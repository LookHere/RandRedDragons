# Shadowrun Encounter: The Dark City

## Overview

The year is 2077, and New York City is a dystopian nightmare. Crime, corruption, and chaos reign supreme.  A new criminal has appeared on the scene, upsetting the powers at be.  This threat to the established order is a rival for power that most people would like to see out of the way. A group of shadowrunners are hired by a mysterious client to infiltrate and sabotage the operations of Hawkshaw and his allies.  In a city of surveillance, the only ones who can do the job are those without a history. Little do they know, they are part of a larger scheme that will put them in the crossfire of a deadly conflict between Hawkshaw and his enemies.

## Characters

- The Shadowrunners: The protagonists of the encounter. They are a team of skilled and experienced mercenaries who specialize in covert and illegal operations. They can be of any metatype, archetype, and background, as long as they have a reason to accept the job and work together. They are unaware of the true identity and motives of the client, and they are led to believe that Hawkshaw is a dangerous criminal who must be stopped. They have never worked in New York before.

- The Client: The person who hires the shadowrunners for the job. His name is Mr. R and he’s the leader of the Ghastly Spectacles, a secret organization that seeks to cleanse the world of corruption and decadence. He has a personal vendetta against Hawkshaw, who is his former protégé and son-in-law. He wants to use the shadowrunners as pawns to weaken Hawkshaw and lure him into a trap.

- Hawkshaw: The main antagonist of the encounter. He is a human who believes he’s a vigilante who uses his skills, resources, and electronics to shift power in New York.  The only way he would have a chance is with the backing of a powerful megacorporation that has a major influence in the city.

- Pennyfellow – Hawkshaw’s Mr. Johnson and body man.  As a Consigliere  he manages Hawkshaw’s grittier affairs.

- Lucy Fox – The megacorporate president that funds Hawkshaw’s technology.  Lucy reluctantly supports Hawkshaw, but doesn’t see any other option to improve the world.  Although a technical genius, her world order is so rigid she can not get beyond supporting the good guy to fight the bad guys.

- Barbs – Librarian with a photographic memory and subject matter expertise in computing.  Her father was always tough on her, trying having her lean into physical instead of mental abilities.  Through grieving for her fathers murder, she fully focused on her martial arts capabilities and joined Hawkshaw to seek revenge.  In the fight she was paralyzed from the waste down.  Although in a wheelchair, she is a formidable competitor in hand to hand combat, continuing to train daily and with hidden weapons in the chair.  She continues to aid Hawkshaw, but now as a master hacker with the handle Orical (her avatar being a stool with 3 legs). She also has long time connections with the police to smooth over any time that Hawkshaw gets in trouble.  Although very shy as a librarian, she built confidence through her physical and mental capabilities and eventually had a (unsuccessful) run for Congress. 

- Ricky is the former protégé of Hawshaw, but became disenchanted and started broke out on his own.  He feels is too serious and too much of a hermit. Ricky sometimes works as a spy, infiltrating criminal organizations. He’s had a romantic history with his former co-worker Barbs and is the polar opposite of Jason Todd.

- Harvrick the Bull – the last good cop in the big apple.  He understands that to uphold the law, you sometimes have to be willing to break it.  He’s been on the force too long, but he doesn’t know how to retire.  He’s slovenly and oafish, but underneath that he’s a smart detective, dedicated to solving crimes. He’s willing to to take a bribe, roughing up a perp, or forging ties with organized crime, all to keep Joe Q. Public safe for another day.

- Kylly – “with two Ls and two Ys” is flirty and nimble, Hawkshaw’s occasional lover is is half fem fetal and half feral, she gets by on her looks and street smarts.  She takes what she wants, both in crime and in love.  Although coming from little her thievery has made her a socialite and philanthropist who runs a charity for poor children, giving her a Robin Hood complex. She is torn between her love for Hawkshaw and her loyalty to the shadowrunners, who are her former associates and friends.

- Anarky - A human anarchist and hacker who opposes Hawkshaw and the corrupt system of New York. He is the leader of a group of rebels who operate from the sewers. He is willing to help the shadowrunners if they share his ideals and goals to “Kill all Kings”.  He views Hawkshaw as a force of oppression so it’s his main target.  He is in love with The Queen of the May, who finds him too boring and juvenile so she doesn’t give him the time of day

- Azrael - A human assassin and zealot who works for the Order of St. Dumas, a secret religious cult that worships Hawkshaw as a messiah. He is sent by the Order to kill the shadowrunners and anyone who interferes with Hawkshaw's mission.

- Black Mask-  A crime lord and businessman who controls a large portion of New York's underworld. He is a rival of Hawkshaw and the other crime bosses, and he is always looking for ways to expand his power and influence. He is interested in hiring the shadowrunners for his own purposes, or eliminating them if they pose a threat.

- Jason Todd - a ruthless and gun-wielding psycopath who kills on sight.  He worked under Hawkshaw but went out on his own to practice more less graphic methods. He is an enemy of Ricky (his former coworker) and once the Shadowrunners make a name more themselves, they become his target as intruders.  Although officially a rival to Mr. R, there is a mutual respect due to their similarities.  He is willing to trade information and goods with the shadowrunners, for a price.

- Frances Gunmoll – the former girlfriend of a kingpin who was killed by Hawkshaw, she has become a proper (if unhinged) violent criminal in her own right.  She is obsessed with avenging her lover's death, and she leads a gang of freaks who terrorize New York. She is an ally of the client, who promises to destroy Hawkshaw.  She makes no efforts to hide her identity, somewhat basking in destruction that follows her as a reflection of the grief in her heart.

- Basil Karlo is the ultimate master of disguises.   He is never seen without expert prosthetic, body suits, and often crutches, so his true look is never known.  Although a very famous Shakespearean actor (though no one knows which one) his interest turned to Cage-ain acting (in the school of Nicolas Cage) after which he could no longer find work.  Mr. R found him waiting tables and hired him as a Mr. Johnson since he can assume any form and personality. He is often impersonate and infiltrate Hawkshaw's allies and enemies to sow confusion and distrust among them.  He may even pretend to be a party member if someone is separated from the group.

- Hush - A human surgeon and serial killer who was once a childhood friend of Hawkshaw. He is obsessed with ruining Hawkshaw's life, and he knows his secret. He is an ally of the client, who provides him with information and resources to target Hawkshaw and his allies.  At the request of Mr. R, he’ll heal the shadowrunners, but don’t turn your back on him or the doctor may ACCIDENTALLY shorten your life instead of extending it.  If Mr. R is crossed, Hush can be hired to test and torture the shadowrunners, and to study their reactions and emotions.

- The Queen of the May – an elf eco-terrorist (former botanist) who is an ally to the client, who promises to restore the balance of the environment if she helps him overthrow Hawkshaw and the megacorps.  She has a strong affinity for nature so her hatred for Hawkshaw is more due to his connection with the mega-corporations, not his work on the streets.  Despite his unending affection, she has no interest in relationships with Anarky, instead practices free love with whoever she chooses, as nature intended.

- Mr. X





## Plot

The encounter consists of multiple scenes and events that lead to the final confrontation between the shadowrunners and Hawkshaw. The plot is not linear, and it can be modified and adapted according to the actions and choices of the shadowrunners and the GM. The following is a possible outline of the plot:

- The shadowrunners are contacted by Mr. Johnson of the client, who is reffered to as **Mr. R**. He offers them a lucrative job: to infiltrate and sabotage the operations of Hawkshaw and his allies in New York. He claims that Hawkshaw is dangerous and poses a threat to the city and the world, and that he has evidence and information that can expose his true identity and motives, but can’t release it out of fear of retribution. He also warns them that Hawkshaw has many enemies and rivals who will try to stop them or use them for their own agendas. He gives them a contact number and a location to meet him for further details.
- The shadowrunners travel to New York, a dark and grim city that is plagued by crime, corruption, and chaos. They encounter various challenges and dangers along the way, such as gangs, cops, security forces, and other shadowrunners. They also have the opportunity to explore the city and interact with its inhabitants, such as the locals, the media, the megacorps, and the metahumans. They can also encounter some of the supporting characters, who can offer them help, information, goods, or trouble, depending on their actions and reputation.
- The shadowrunners meet the client at a secret location, such as an abandoned warehouse, a hidden bunker, or a secluded mansion. The client reveals his identity as Ra's al Ghul, the leader of the Ghastly Spectacles, and explains his plan and motives. He tells them that he is the father of **Talia al Ghul**, the wife of Hawkshaw and the mother of his son, **Damian Wayne**. He says that he once trained and mentored Hawkshaw, and that he wanted him to be his successor and heir. However, Hawkshaw betrayed him and rejected his vision of a new world order, and that he has been his enemy ever since. He says that he wants to destroy Hawkshaw and his legacy, and that he needs the shadowrunners to help him achieve his goal. He gives them a list of targets and objectives, such as:

    - Steal or destroy Hawkshaw's equipment and vehicles, such as the Batmobile, the Batwing, the Batcave, and the Batcomputer.
    - Hack or sabotage Hawkshaw's communications and networks, such as the Oracle, the Bat-Signal, and the Justice League.

Sure, I’ll continue the story from where I left off. Here is the next part:

- Kidnap or assassinate Hawkshaw's allies and contacts, such as Pennyfellow, Lucy, Barbara, Dick, Tim, and Kyly. 
- Expose or blackmail Hawkshaw's secret identity and activities, such as Bruce Wayne, Wayne Enterprises, and the Justice League.
- Provoke or manipulate Hawkshaw's enemies and rivals, such as Black Mask, Penguin, Two-Face, and Red Hood, to attack him or his interests.
- Lure or trap Hawkshaw into a final confrontation, where Ra's al Ghul will reveal himself and his plan, and attempt to kill him and his son.

The shadowrunners accept the job, and begin to execute the plan. They use their skills, resources, and contacts to infiltrate and sabotage Hawkshaw's operations, while avoiding or fighting his enemies and rivals. They also encounter some of the supporting characters, who can help or hinder them, depending on their actions and reputation. They also face some challenges and complications, such as:

- Hawkshaw is not an easy target, and he is always one step ahead of them. He is aware of their presence and their actions, and he tries to stop them or capture them. He also uses his allies and contacts to assist him, such as the Oracle, the Teen Titans, and the Justice League.
- The shadowrunners are not the only ones who are after Hawkshaw. They have to compete or cooperate with other shadowrunners, mercenaries, assassins, and bounty hunters who are hired by Hawkshaw's enemies and rivals, or who have their own motives and agendas.
- The shadowrunners are not fully loyal to the client, and they have their own goals and interests. They can choose to betray the client, switch sides, double-cross, or negotiate with Hawkshaw or his allies or enemies, depending on their morals, ethics, and incentives.
- The shadowrunners are not immune to the effects of the city and the people. They can be affected by the crime, corruption, and chaos that plague New York, and they can be influenced by the fear, anger, and madness that infect its inhabitants. They can also be tempted by the power, wealth, and fame that the city offers, or be inspired by the hope, justice, and heroism that Hawkshaw represents.

The encounter culminates in a final showdown between the shadowrunners and Hawkshaw, where Ra's al Ghul reveals himself and his plan, and attempts to kill Hawkshaw and his son. The outcome of the encounter depends on the actions and choices of the shadowrunners and the GM, and it can have various consequences and implications for the future of New York and the world.




Can you tell me more about the what the shadow runners are asked to do? What quests do they go on?
Sure, I can tell you more about the shadowrunners’ tasks and quests. Here are some examples of what they are asked to do by the client:

Steal the Batmobile: The shadowrunners are hired to steal Hawkshaw’s iconic vehicle, the Batmobile, from a secret garage in New York. They have to bypass the security systems, hack the vehicle’s controls, and escape with it before Hawkshaw or his allies catch them. They can use the Batmobile for their own purposes, sell it to the highest bidder, or deliver it to the client, who will use it to lure Hawkshaw into a trap.
Hack the Oracle: The shadowrunners are hired to hack the Oracle, the codename of Barbara Gordon, the former sidekick and hacker of Hawkshaw. She is the eyes and ears of Hawkshaw and his allies, and she monitors and coordinates their activities from a hidden base. The shadowrunners have to infiltrate her base, hack her systems, and steal or destroy her data. They can also try to capture or kill her, or turn her against Hawkshaw, by using blackmail, threats, or persuasion.
Kidnap Pennyfellow: The shadowrunners are hired to kidnap Pennyfellow, the loyal butler and confidant of Hawkshaw. He is the caretaker of Wayne Manor, the ancestral home of Hawkshaw and his secret identity, Bruce Wayne. He is also a skilled medic, mechanic, and fighter, who assists Hawkshaw and his allies. The shadowrunners have to break into Wayne Manor, subdue Pennyfellow, and take him to the client, who will use him as a hostage or a bargaining chip to force Hawkshaw to surrender.
Expose Bruce Wayne: The shadowrunners are hired to expose the secret identity of Hawkshaw, Bruce Wayne, the billionaire CEO of Wayne Enterprises. He is a powerful and influential figure in New York, who uses his wealth and resources to fund and support Hawkshaw and his allies. He is also a member of the Justice League, a team of superheroes who protect the world from global threats. The shadowrunners have to find and leak evidence of his dual life, such as photos, videos, documents, or witnesses, to the media, the public, or his enemies, and ruin his reputation and credibility.



Can you add some plot twists?
Sure, I can add some plot twists to the shadowrun encounter. Here are some examples of what could happen:

The shadowrunners discover that one of their teammates is actually Basil, a shapeshifter who was hired by the client to spy on them and sabotage their mission. He reveals his true form and attacks them, or he tries to escape and warn the client.
The shadowrunners encounter Catwoman, a cat burglar and thief who has a complicated relationship with Hawkshaw. She is also Kyly Kyle, a socialite and philanthropist who runs a charity for stray cats and orphans. She is torn between her love for Hawkshaw and her loyalty to the shadowrunners, who are her former associates and friends. She can help or hinder them, depending on their actions and reputation.
The shadowrunners are contacted by Hawkshaw, who offers them a deal. He tells them that he knows who they are and what they are doing, and that he wants to talk to them. He says that he can offer them more money, information, or protection than the client, and that he can help them escape from New York. He also says that he can reveal the truth about the client and his plan, and that he can prove that he is not the enemy. He asks them to meet him at a secret location, where he will show them something that will change their minds.
The shadowrunners are betrayed by the client, who reveals that he never intended to pay them or let them live. He says that he used them as pawns to weaken Hawkshaw and lure him into a trap, and that he plans to kill them along with Hawkshaw and his son. He activates a bomb or a trap that he planted in their equipment or location, or he sends his assassins or allies to eliminate them.

weave more shadowrun elements into the story


Okay, I’ll try to weave more shadowrun elements into the story. Here are some examples of how I could do that:

I could add more details and descriptions of the shadowrun setting, such as the megacorporations, the matrix, the magic, the metahumans, the cyberware, and the bioware. For example, I could mention how the shadowrunners use their commlinks, cyberdecks, drones, and spells to hack, infiltrate, and fight their way through the city, and how they encounter different races and factions, such as elves, orcs, trolls, dwarves, humans, ghouls, vampires, shapeshifters, gangs, cults, and corporations.

I could also mention how they are related to or influenced by other shadowrun characters and locations, such as Dunkelzahn, Ghostwalker, Lofwyr, Harlequin, FastJack, Winterhawk, Jackpoint, NeoNET, Renraku, Ares, Knight Errant, Lone Star, and the UCAS.
I could add more challenges and complications that are specific to the shadowrun genre, such as the security, the law, the ethics, the politics, and the morality. For example, I could mention how the shadowrunners have to deal with the security forces, the law enforcement, the hackers, the mages, the spirits, the critters, and the runners who are trying to stop them or compete with them. I could also mention how they have to face ethical, political, and moral dilemmas, such as whether to work for or against the megacorps, the governments, the factions, the people, and the environment.

Okay, I’ll try to add more challenges and complications specific to shadowrun. Here is how I could do that:

- The shadowrunners have to deal with the security forces, the law enforcement, the hackers, the mages, the spirits, the critters, and the runners who are trying to stop them or compete with them. For example, they could face:

    - Ares Macrotechnology, one of the largest and most powerful megacorporations in the world, and the owner of Knight Errant, a private security company that provides law enforcement services to New York. Ares has a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and protecting its assets and secrets, and it will not hesitate to use its military and technological might to eliminate any threats or intruders. Ares is also a rival of Wayne Enterprises, and it has been trying to undermine and sabotage its business and reputation for years.
    - The Matrix, the global network of data and information that connects and controls almost everything in the Sixth World. The Matrix is a dangerous and unpredictable place, where hackers, viruses, artificial intelligences, and other threats lurk and prey on the unwary and the unprepared. The Matrix is also the domain of Hawkshaw and his allies, who use it to monitor and coordinate their activities, and to hack and sabotage their enemies. The shadowrunners have to navigate and survive the Matrix, while avoiding or fighting Hawkshaw and his allies, and other hackers and entities who may interfere with their mission.
    - The Astral Plane, the metaphysical realm of magic and spirits that coexists with the physical world. The Astral Plane is a mysterious and mystical place, where mages, adepts, shamans, and other awakened beings can perceive and manipulate the essence and energy of all things.

    - The Critters, the various animals and creatures that have been affected by the Awakening, the event that brought magic back to the world. The Critters are diverse and unpredictable, ranging from mundane and harmless, to exotic and dangerous, to paranormal and deadly. Some Critters are intelligent and sentient, and have their own cultures and agendas. Some Critters are loyal and friendly, and can be allies or pets. Some Critters are hostile and aggressive, and can be enemies or prey. The shadowrunners have to encounter and interact with the Critters, while avoiding or fighting Hawkshaw and his allies, and other Critters who may harm or help them.
    - The Runners, the other shadowrunners, mercenaries, assassins, and bounty hunters who are hired by Hawkshaw's enemies and rivals, or who have their own motives and agendas.

- The shadowrunners have to face ethical, political, and moral dilemmas, such as whether to work for or against the megacorps, the governments, the factions, the people, and the environment. For example, they could face:

    - The Megacorps, the multinational corporations that dominate and control most aspects of life in the Sixth World. The Megacorps are powerful and influential, and they have their own laws, armies, and agendas. The Megacorps are greedy and ruthless, and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals and interests, regardless of the consequences and costs. The Megacorps are also rich and resourceful, and they can offer the shadowrunners money, information, or protection, in exchange for their services and loyalty. The shadowrunners have to decide whether to work for or against the Megacorps, and which Megacorps to trust or betray, depending on their values, beliefs, and benefits.
    - The Governments, the various political entities and organizations that claim and exercise authority and power over the people and the territory in the Sixth World. The Governments are diverse and complex, and they have their own laws, policies, and ideologies. The Governments are corrupt and ineffective, and they often fail to protect and serve the people and the environment, and to maintain peace and order. The Governments are also legitimate and necessary, and they can offer the shadowrunners citizenship, rights, or justice, in exchange for their cooperation and compliance. The shadowrunners have to decide whether to work for or against the Governments, and which Governments to support or oppose, depending on their views, opinions, and ideals.
    - The Factions, the various groups and communities that have their own identities, cultures, and goals in the Sixth World. The Factions are diverse and dynamic, and they have their own values, beliefs, and traditions.

The Factions are also friendly and cooperative, and they can offer the shadowrunners membership, friendship, or assistance, in exchange for their respect and contribution. The shadowrunners have to decide whether to work for or against the Factions, and which Factions to join or leave, depending on their backgrounds, affiliations, and preferences.

The shadowrunners have to decide whether to work for or against the People, and which People to help or harm, depending on their emotions, attitudes, and morals.

The Environment is also alive and magical, and it can offer the shadowrunners harmony, balance, or power, in exchange for their care and respect.

That’s an interesting idea. I’ll try to create a character based on Elon Musk. Here is what I came up with:
# Elon X

## Background

Elon X is a human entrepreneur and inventor who is the founder, CEO, and CTO of X Corp., a megacorporation that specializes in aerospace, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence. He is also the owner and CTO of Twitter, a social media platform that he acquired in 2022. He is one of the richest and most influential people in the world, with an estimated net worth of over $200 billion.

Elon X is a visionary and a genius, who has a passion for innovation and exploration. He is driven by his goals of advancing humanity and making the world a better place. He is also a philanthropist and a humanitarian, who supports various causes and charities, such as education, health, environment, and peace.

However, Elon X is also a controversial and secretive figure, who has many enemies and rivals. He is often accused of being a megalomaniac, a narcissist, a sociopath, or a mad scientist, who is obsessed with his own ego and agenda. He is also suspected of being involved in illegal and unethical activities, such as hacking, espionage, sabotage, and assassination, using his vast resources and networks.

## Secret Mission

Elon X is actually a hero, who is on a secret mission to save the world from a looming threat. He is aware of the existence of a shadowy organization called the Court of Owls, a secret society of wealthy and powerful elites who have been ruling Gotham and the world from the shadows for centuries. They are also a cult that worships an ancient owl spirit, and they use cybernetically enhanced assassins called Talons to eliminate their enemies.

Elon X has been secretly investigating and infiltrating the Court of Owls, using his skills, resources, and contacts. He has also been recruiting and training a team of loyal and talented operatives, who share his vision and mission. He calls them the X-Men, and they are his allies and friends.

Elon X's ultimate goal is to expose and destroy the Court of Owls, and to free the world from their tyranny and corruption. He believes that he is the only one who can do it, and that he has to do it alone. He does not trust or cooperate with anyone else, not even the Batman, who he sees as a rival and a nuisance.

## Interaction with the Batman Characters

Elon X has a complex and conflicted relationship with the Batman and his allies and enemies. He respects and admires the Batman's skills and achievements, but he also dislikes and distrusts his methods and motives. He considers the Batman to be a vigilante, a threat, or a competitor, who interferes with his plans and goals. He also knows the Batman's secret identity, and he has a personal vendetta against him, as he blames him for the death of his wife, Talia al Ghul, who was the daughter of Ra's al Ghul, and the mother of his son, Damian Wayne.

Elon X has a similar relationship with the Batman's allies and enemies. He sees them as potential allies or assets, or as enemies or obstacles, depending on their actions and reputation. He can offer them help, information, or goods, or he can target them for attack, sabotage, or manipulation. He can also try to recruit or convert them to his side, or to turn them against the Batman or the Court of Owls.

Some examples of Elon X's interaction with the Batman characters are:

- He hires the shadowrunners to infiltrate and sabotage the Batman's operations, while providing them with information and resources. He also warns them of the dangers and risks that they face, and advises them on how to deal with the Batman and his allies and enemies. He also plans to betray them, if they prove to be unreliable or untrustworthy, or if they interfere with his goals.
- He encounters Catwoman, a cat burglar and thief who has a complicated relationship with the Batman. He is also Selina Kyle, a socialite and philanthropist who runs a charity for stray cats and orphans. He is torn between his love for the Batman and his loyalty to the shadowrunners, who are his former associates and friends. He tries to persuade her to join his side, or he lets her go, or he fights her reluctantly.
- He contacts the Batman, who he offers a deal. He tells him that he knows who he is and what he is doing, and that he wants to talk to him. He says that he can offer him more money, information, or protection than the Court of Owls, and that he can help him escape from Gotham. He also says that he can reveal the truth about the Court of Owls and his plan, and that he can prove that he is not the enemy. He asks him to meet him at a secret location, where he will show him something that will change his mind.
- He is betrayed by the Court of Owls, who reveal that they never intended to let him live. They say that they used him as a pawn to weaken the Batman and lure him into a trap, and that they plan to kill him along with the Batman and his son. They activate a bomb or a trap that they planted in his equipment or location, or they send their Talons or allies to eliminate him.
